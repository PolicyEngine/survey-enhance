# Enhancing UK survey microdata with machine learning

## Loss

The notion of accuracy is not well-defined, and any attempt to measure it inevitably is biased by the choice of objective function. For example, one could define accuracy for a given dataset as how well it reproduces employment income aggregates (e.g. the relative error between the known best estimate and the sum of weighted employment incomes in the dataset): a survey could score highly on this task but produce inaccurate estimates of total self-employment incomes. Some degree of subjectivity is inevitable, because accuracy is a means to an end: researchers are interested in the accuracy of a dataset for a particular purpose, and may flexibly set their own accuracy function.
