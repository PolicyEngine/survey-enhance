# Datasets

The `survey_enhance.reweight` module contains two classes which can be used to define a loss architecture and minimise it for a given survey.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: survey_enhance.reweight.CalibratedWeights
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: survey_enhance.reweight.LossCategory
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :show-inheritance:
```
